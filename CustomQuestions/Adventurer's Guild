Adventurer's Guild

Guild system:
The guild accepts any valid quests from people of Yggdrasil. The person giving the quest must offer atleast a minimum of the reward, the reward is based on the quest rank, which is 
assessed by the guild. The guild posts these quests on the quests board. Adventurers can accept quests as long as they meet the requirements. Adventurers are recommended to 
accept quest equal to their rank. However, they can accept quests 1 rank higher than their own rank, but if they fail they receive a penalty. The adventurer must meet the completion 
requirement in order to receive the quest's rewards. The guild takes 10% and the adventurer takes 90% of the reward. If more than one adventurer has completed the reward, it is divided equally
among them. If an adventurer fails a quest, the quest is reposted on the quest board. If a quest has been failed more than 3 times by different adventurers, where the quest rank and adventurer 
rank is equal, the quest is raised by 1 rank. An adventurer cannot take the same quest again that they fail. An adventurer is to report any information regarding the quest they completed/failed.
